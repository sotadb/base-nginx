		<h1>Welcome to NGiNX, SotADB edition</h1>
		<p>If you're reading this, NGiNX is setup and running. It's 
		configured to serve static content, unencrypted to port 8080. 
		This is intended to be used behind Kubernetes' ingress server,
		which should also provide the SSL endpoint. All security 
		setting should be provided there.</p>

		<p>This particular configuration was created to serve as a 
		foundational container for <a href="www.sotadb.info">www.sotadb.info</a>. 
		It has been made public, so feel free to use it. If you have any 
		observations about how it can be improved (particularly how it's security
		can be improved) please post an 
		<a href="https://github.com/sotadb/nginx">issue to our github issues page</a>.</p>
