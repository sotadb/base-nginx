		<h1>Welcome to NGiNX, SotADB edition</h1>
		<p>If you're reading this, NGiNX is setup and running. It's configured for SSL, and pulled an SSL cert 
		from <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/">Let's Encrypt</a>. <a href="https://weakdh.org/sysadmin.html"> 
		"Export" Cypher Suites have been disabled, Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange has been enabled, 
		and a safe, strong, 2048-bit prime Diffie-Hellman group was generated.</a> This can be tested with 
		<a href="https://ssllabs.com/ssltest/">Qualsys' SSL Server Test</a>.</p>

		<p>With the exception of some management pages, CSP is enabled, and set to "self". This instructs 
		web-browser to deny loading inline scripts or resources from external sites, and possibly will need 
		overriden.</p>

		<p>This particular configuration was created to serve as a secure foundational container for 
		<a href="www.sotadb.info">www.sotadb.info</a>. It has been made public, so feel free to use it. If you have
		any observations about how it can be improved (particularly how it's security can be improved) please post 
		an <a href="https://github.com/sotadb/nginx">issue to our github issues page</a>.</p>
